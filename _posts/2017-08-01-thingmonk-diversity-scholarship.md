<h1 class="text-center">ThingMonk 2017 Diversity Scholarship</h1>
<p />
We have been privileged to work with a wonderfully diverse group of people since starting ThingMonk, and
make a point of creating a conference where everyone is welcome. Sadly there is always far more work to
be done to help with diversity in tech. 
<p />
This year we are once again running our diversity scholarship at ThingMonk.
You can apply for this scholarship by filling in <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/hIzscf9ZdYXuh5w82">this form</a>, we will get back to 
everyone that has applied over August and early September. 
<p />
All of us at <a href="http://redmonk.com">RedMonk</a> are privileged and immensely grateful to the work within our community, 
and with people that want to help the technology industry become a more diverse and welcoming place. 
<p />
Tickets for ThingMonk are <a href="http://bit.ly/tmonk2017">on sale now</a>.
