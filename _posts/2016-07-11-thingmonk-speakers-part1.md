We are delighted to announce the first group of speakers for ThingMonk 2016. <br />
This year sees us diving further into the The Things Network, one of the most important grass 
roots projects in IoT, with <a href="http://twitter.com/johanstokking">Johann Stokking</a> joining us.
<p />  
ThingMonk alumni <a href="http://twitter.com/aallan">Alasdair Allan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/yoditstanton">Yodit Stanton</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/samphippen">Sam Phippen</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thingmonk">Dave McCrory</a> are all making welcome 
returns. 
<p />
We are also delighted to be joined by <a href="http://twitter.com/synedra">Kirsten Hunter</a>, who will 
be talking and demoing her opensource project around quantified fitness, which people will also be able 
to hack around with on Day zero.
<p />
