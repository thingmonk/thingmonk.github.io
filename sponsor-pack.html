<h2>THINGMONK 2017<br />
    DEVELOPERS, DATA, DESIGN: THE NEW INDUSTRIAL</h2>
<p>
ThingMonk is the developer conference for people making IoT platforms. We bring together technologists and designers building core infrastructure for IoT for 2 days of awesome, unique talks on topics including bots, industrial automation/industry 4.0, machine learning, time series data, programming language choices and UX. These are talks by practitioners.
<p>
We’re not cheerleaders for thoughtless automation- we’ll have skeptical, thoughtful critical talks about creating a culture and making the right design decisions so that the IoT serves us, rather than us serving it
<p>
ThingMonk will be held on September 12th and 13th 2017 in London. This year we are also running a  pre-event coding workshop / hackday running for the afternoon and evening of September 11th and co-hosting an event with The Eclipse Foundation on the morning of September 11th (seperate <a href="eclipse-sponsor-pack.html">sponsor pack</a> available). The coding workshop will be the culmination of a series of online events and promotions beginning in April 2017. 
<p>
The event is designed to bridge startup, Web platform, enterprise and industrial automation IoT communities. We bring elite developers and practitioners together, fostering cross-sector collaboration.
<p>
This year’s themes include:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Data, Analytics, Time Series and IOT: how do use, present and aggregate data at IOT scale<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Machine Learning and IOT: how to use machine learning, data and IOT<br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Design and IOT:  designing for users, their context and scale<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Industrial IOT and IOT in manufacturing<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - IOT and Sustainability<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - IOT Programming Models<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Full stack IOT: The power of the network, how connected devices, platforms, services and data come together<br />
<p>
ThingMonk itself will run as a single track conference over 2 days.  We’ll kick off with data and IoT on September 12th, and the conversation will continue with an evening event curated by RedMonk. ThingMonk 2017 will be a signature event, and experience to remember. We don’t allow pitches, we don’t sell speaking slots, and every talk will be created exclusively for the event, video recorded to scale distribution. 
<p>
<h2>Why Sponsor?</h2>
<p>
ThingMonk will be fun, informative, but most importantly will bring different communities together, in a high profile developer and practitioner conference. This is an opportunity to reach a top notch audience of technical resources that transcend traditional developer categories. The Internet of Things will be built by software developers - the people that come to this event - and we’ll have 180 attendees for this years event.

    At RedMonk we have always been committed to diversity, and at ThingMonk 2016 we launched an incredibly successful diversity scholarship program. We continued this program at Monkigras 2017, and intend to expand it further at ThingMonk 2017. Your funding allows us to bring applicants from a variety of backgrounds to an event with some of the brightest minds in technology. Sponsoring the diversity scholarship requires more than a dollar commitment, we will ask you to collaborate with us on the program and to be available during the conference to meet and mentor the programme participants.
