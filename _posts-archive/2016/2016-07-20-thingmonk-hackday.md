<h1 class="text-center">The Return of the ThingMonk Hackday</h1>
<p>
We are bringing the ThingMonk hackday back, and it is going to be epic. Sponsored by <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> we are going to have Watson APIs, Amazon Echo devices, and also plan to introduce you to the wonderful world of Thington. Our plan is to have a short Watson and Alexa Skills (tbc) workshops to kick things off  - we have been talking about Conversational IoT for the last couple of years, so it's time to start building it. People talking to machines talking to people.
<p />
We'll definitely have some Echos to play with, and expect a couple of giveaways too. This won't be a competitive event, but a great place to learn and meet people building cool things. As day fades into evening we're also going to recreate the experience of 2014 when we had a power cut. That's right- we will be coding by candlelight again. Expect lovely drinks to suit the atmosphere.
