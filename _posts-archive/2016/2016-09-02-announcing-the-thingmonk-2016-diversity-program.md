<h1 class="text-center">Announcing: The ThingMonk 2016 Diversity Programme</h1>
<p>
Here at ThingMonk, diversity is a special focus for us. It’s not something we just say we champion; we actually put significant time and thought into ensuring that groups under-represented in tech, will get all the tools they need to start a new future. And that doesn’t just mean a free ticket to attend our event. 
<p>
We want to ensure that each one of our very special scholars gets the absolute most out of attending this event. We want them to leave with a pocket full of business cards, a head full of ideas, and inspiration to carry them through to the next step of their journey into an IoT career.
<p>
So this year, we are proud to announce the very first <b>ThingMonk Diversity Programme</b>. 
<p>
First, it of course includes a free ticket to attend all 3 days of ThingMonk. That’s thanks to our great friend and leading light of IoT in London <a href="https://twitter.com/yoditstanton">Yodit Stanton</a> and her team at <a href="http://opensensors.io">OpenSensors.io</a>. 
<p>
It includes a strong <a href="http://thingmonk.com/index.html#coc">diversity policy statement</a>, which <a href="https://twitter.com/coderinheels">Gen Ashley</a>, Director at Women Who Code, helped us develop. 
<p>
It includes a Mentorship programme, where our scholars will be paired up with an influencer from the IoT industry each day. The mentor will meet with the scholars twice per day, to introduce the scholars to one another (ensuring they know at least one other person at the event), provide an overview of the day with highlights and can’t-miss events, and learn something unique about each one. This will help the mentor identify potential networking contacts for the scholar, and to broker those introductions during the conference. This will help cement relationships and to make connections. 
<p>
At the end of the day, another meeting between mentor and scholars should occur, to hear what they enjoyed most and to get an idea of their excitement. 
<p>
We are delighted to announce that our mentors include <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMmmm">Ian Massingham</a>, Chief Evangelist for EMEA at Amazon Web Services; <a href="https://twitter.com/IanSkerrett">Ian Skerrett</a>, Vice President of Marketing at The Eclipse Foundation; <a href="https://twitter.com/coderinheels">Gen Ashley</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/fintanr">Fintan Ryan</a>, Industry Analyst at RedMonk; and <a href="https://twitter.com/samphippen">Sam Phippen</a>, Engineer at Digital Ocean. 
<p>
It includes asking the scholars to follow our official <a href="https://twitter.com/thingmonk">@thingmonk</a> account on Twitter, where we will introduce each scholar, highlighting a unique point or goal of each. This will help build the scholar’s network, it will give them some social clout, and it will introduce them to potential employers in the marketplace. 
<p>
It includes asking each scholar to write up a summary of their experience for each day and the entire event, which we will publish on the <a href="http://thingmonk.com">thingmonk.com</a> website and also share via social media. 
<p>
It includes the generous gift of a free book to continue their learning, <a href="http://webofthings.org/book/">Building the Web of Things</a>, from author <a href="https://twitter.com/domguinard">Dominique D. Guinard</a>, to give the scholars a hands-on guide that teaches how to design and implement scalable, flexible and industry-ready IoT solutions on the Web. 
<p>
It includes a free pack of <a href="http://moo.com">MOO</a> business cards for each scholar, so that when they arrive at ThingMonk, they can sail through introductions and feel like a part of our attending workforce. Huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager">Meri Williams</a>, Chief Technology Officer at MOO.
<p>
It’s resulted in a record-bursting 21 scholarship applications for 10 available spots. So we accepted them all. Every single one. 
<p>
We are extremely proud of our diversity programme, and hope it provides a guideline to other conferences about goals they can set, and objectives they can achieve. After all, we’re all in this together.
