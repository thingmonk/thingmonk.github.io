<h1 class="text-center">ThingMonk 2016 Diversity Scholarship, sponsored by OpenSensors.io</h1>
<p />
We have been privileged to work with a wonderfully diverse group of people since starting ThingMonk, and
make a point of creating a conference where everyone is welcome. Sadly there is always far more work to
be done to help with diversity in tech. 
<p />
This year the team at <a href="http://opensensors.io">OpenSensors.io</a> are sponsoring a diversity 
scholarship at ThingMonk, which allows us to further extend a program that has been quitely running since
the conference began. You can apply for this scholarship by filling in <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/vvp8OY8ktCDVsXPu1">this form</a>, we will get back to 
everyone that has applied later this month. 
<p />
All of us at <a href="http://redmonk.com">RedMonk</a> are privileged and immensely grateful to the work within our community, and especially to 
companies like <a href="http://opensensors.io">OpenSensors</a>, that want to help the technology industry become a more diverse and welcoming place. 
<p />
