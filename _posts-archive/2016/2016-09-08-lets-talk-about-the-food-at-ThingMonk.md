<h1 class="text-center">Let’s talk about the food at ThingMonk.</h1>
<p>
As ever, we like to work with small, local, independent suppliers to deliver high quality delicious food which caters for most tastes, including vegetarians and vegans. 
<p>
On Day 0, we’ll have pastries and fruit for breakfast, salads and sandwiches for lunch, and brownies and banana bread at the coffee break, all courtesy of <a href="http://www.cream-shoreditch.com">Cream</a>, the daytime canteen. We find their fare to be tasty and wholesome, with a menu developed by one of the hottest chefs in London, Magnus Reid. 
<p>
For the attendees of Coding by Candlelight, we’ve lined up a special working supper: The Holy Cheese Mountain by <a href="http://www.rawcheesepower.com">Raw Cheese Power</a>. As a one-off special just for us, they’re bringing a fresh tomato soup with basil pesto, homebaked bread and a selection of other goodies including pickles, which will be positioned to look like the mountains surrounding Lake Como. Coffees and teas are provided throughout the day followed by beers and wine during the coding. 
<p>
On Day 1, pastries and fruit will again be available for breakfast with coffee and tea during Registration, 9.15-10am. For lunch, we are excited about a Venezuelan delicacy, arepas from <a href="http://arepaandco.com">Arepa & Co</a>, one of the hottest food trends in London according to chef Yotam Ottolenghi.  Curry for supper at 7pm will be provided by Shoreditch’s best kept secret. Don’t miss it! Beer and wine will be on tap for your enjoyment at the social. 
<p>
Day 2 will again feature pastries, fruit, coffees and teas for a light breakfast. Skipping north from Venezuela to Mexico, Pink Cactus will set up their street food stall and serve us with a selection of delicious tacos. 
<p>
We really hope you enjoy the food as much as we think you will. See you there!
