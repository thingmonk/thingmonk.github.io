<h1 class="text-center">Eclipse IoT Day @ Thingmonk</h1>
p>One of my favourite IoT events is the <a href="http://thingmonk.com/">Thingmonk </a>conference produced by Redmonk. The speakers and attendees are always amazing and provide great insight into the IoT community in the UK and Europe.   This year the <a href="http://thingmonk.com/index.html#speakers">speaker line-up for Thingmonk </a>is looking awesome so I expect to learn lots again this year.</p>
<p>A new addition for Thingmonk this year is that we are organizing an <a href="http://thingmonk.com/index.html#speakerseclipse">Eclipse IoT Day @ Thingmonk </a>on Day 0. We are planning an equally <a href="http://thingmonk.com/index.html#speakerseclipse">awesome line-up of speakers</a> that will showcase how open source and Eclipse IoT has changing the IoT industry. The Eclipse IoT Day speaker will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamil Baczkowicz from DeltaRail will be talking about their experiences of using MQTT and Eclipse IoT for building signal-control systems for railways. This will be real IoT in action!</li>
<li>Patrizia Gufler from IBM Watson will showcase her work for integrating Eclipse Kura with IBM Watson.</li>
<li>Kai Hudalla from Bosch will continue an IoT cloud theme in his talk about an Open IoT stack for IoT@cloud-scale.</li>
<li>Our very own Benjamin Cabe will also be talking about the Eclipse IoT open strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to announce a few more speakers over the next couple of weeks. It should be pretty awesome.</p>
<p>After the Eclipse IoT Day, will be the <a href="http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk/cfp/2016/07/20/thingmonk-hackday.html">Thingmonk HackDay</a>. I fully expect to see further hacks on integrating Eclipse Kura with IBM Watson, Eclipse IoT running on Cloud Foundry and IBM Watson, and I am sure Benjamin will bring along some new boards.</p>
<p>This is going to be a great way to kick-off Thingmonk. Eclipse IoT Day @ Thingmonk is September 12 and Thingmonk is September 13-14. The costs for Eclipse IoT Day is £50.00 . You will want to stay for the full 3 days and that costs only £200.00.  This is a great event that you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
