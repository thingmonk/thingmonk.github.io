<p><a href="http://thingmonk.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/', 'Thingmonk 2016']);" >Thingmonk 2016</a> is shaping up really nicely and it&#8217;s coming soon. September this year. We&#8217;ll bring you the usual mix of amazing talks, warm and whipsmart people lovely food and drink experiences, and&#8230; we&#8217;re bringing sexy back. That is &#8211; after a hiatus last year, we&#8217;re doubling down on our hackday.</p>
<p>Day Zero kicks off with a half day conference within a conference curated by the Eclipse Foundation. I would argue that of the open source foundations Eclipse has done the most successful, targeted job of making itself the home of IoT standardisation. One of the reasons the machine 2 machine (M2M) wave never took was it was trying to use old school standardisation by specification mechanisms. Standards in software today are built differently &#8211; by implementation, a revolution that Eclipse helped foment. When a company like Bosch is on the record as saying that <a href="http://blog.bosch-si.com/categories/technology/2015/10/software-provisioning-goes-open-source-find/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.bosch-si.com/categories/technology/2015/10/software-provisioning-goes-open-source-find/', 'IoT won&#8217;t succeed without an open source first approach']);" >IoT won&#8217;t succeed without an open source first approach</a> you know things are changing dramatically in the industrial internet space. Check out <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/hawkbit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/hawkbit', 'hawkBit']);" >hawkBit</a>. Bosch will be presenting at the <a href="http://thingmonk.com/eclipse-day-talks.html#" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/eclipse-day-talks.html#', 'Eclipse day']);" >Eclipse day</a> on standardisation via platforms like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hono" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.hono', 'Hono']);" >Hono</a>. Also &#8211; How about <a href="http://thingmonk.com/eclipse-day-talks.html#kamilfb84" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/eclipse-day-talks.html#kamilfb84', 'Running UK railways']);" >Running UK railways</a> with Eclipse Paho &amp; Mosquitto? More info about the Eclipse agenda from Ian Skerrett <a href="https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/eclipse-iot-day-thingmonk/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/eclipse-iot-day-thingmonk/', 'here']);" >here</a>.</p>
<p>Following the Eclipse talks we&#8217;ll have a hackday with workshops on IoT programming with IBM Watson, <a href="https://www.pycom.io/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.pycom.io/', 'Pycom']);" >Pycom</a> (anyone for drones finding Pokemon?) and Amazon Alexa Skills (tbc). We have been talking about Conversational IoT for the last couple of years, so it&#8217;s time to start building it. People talking to machines talking to people. We&#8217;ll definitely have some Echos to play with, and expect a couple of giveaways too. This won&#8217;t be a competitive event, but a great place to learn, meet people and build cool things. We’ll finish the day <a href="http://www.codingbycandlelight.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.codingbycandlelight.com/', 'Coding by Candelight']);" >Coding by Candelight</a> until 9pm.</p>
<p>Day one and two will be the aforementioned excellent talks. Kicking off will be <a href="http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#samphippen" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#samphippen', 'Sam Phippen']);" >Sam Phippen</a> &#8211; his closer in 2015 was so mind-blowing we had to have him kick off this time around.</p>
<p>Bots, <a href="http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#mccrory" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#mccrory', 'data wrangling']);" >data wrangling</a>, Design, startups, industrial automation/Industry 4.0 (Bosch again), <a href="http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#synedra" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#synedra', 'quantifying your fitness']);" >quantifying your fitness</a>,</p>
<p>We’re certainly not cheerleaders for thoughtless automation though- we’ll have skeptical, deeply critical talks about creating a culture and making the right design decisions so that the IoT serves us, rather than us serving it. <a href="http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#edent" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thingmonk.com/thingmonk-talks.html#edent', 'Terry Eden']);" >Terry Eden</a> will explain why you should run screaming from the Internet of Things in a domestic setting.</p>
<p>ThingMonk is about tech but it’s also about creating a warm, supportive, welcoming and diverse community. This year we are honoured to introduce a special diversity scholarship sponsored by OpenSensors.io. Please apply if you&#8217;re from an under-represented group in tech.</p>
<p>Buy your tickets for the conference <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingmonk-2016-tickets-24733051222" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingmonk-2016-tickets-24733051222', 'here']);" >here</a>. More sponsors are also of course always welcome.</p>
