  bio: Roslyn founded MobiCycle Ltd, a electronic waste tech startup that addresses the challenges around motivating consumers to change their behaviour, in 2012. EAdvisor helps consumers who lack either the time to be more sustainable, or are unaware of local options for recycling, who rely on public transport, are unable to access facilities. Sensors4Bins sends waste data collected by sensors to a dashboard via low power wide area networks. Organisations can track how much waste is in their containers by tonnage (as opposed to volume) and gauge how well their recycling programmes are changing consumer behaviour, on a bin by bin basis
