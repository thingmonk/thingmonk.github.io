  talktitle: Makers of Marvels
  talkabstract: History teaches us that astonishing feats occur not when a singular leader envisions them, but when a mass of skilled workers collaborate to transform that vision into something material. The Transcontinental Railroad, for example, was not built overnight, but constructed by tens of thousands of workers over a period of years. The outcome indelibly changed transcontinental transportation and logistics. The iPhone has transformed the world as we know it -- but most of its power comes from the app store, which offers thousands of apps created from the imaginations of developers employing their expertise in UX, machine learning, IoT and much more. These developers are the makers of marvels in our time. They instantiate the very concept of digital transformation -- that notion of infrastructure disruption and re-assembly on the mind of every CIO. This enterprise software is no longer just driving computer infrastructure. Today it drives real infrastructure from wind turbines to automobiles and everything in between. Digital transformation is at the heart of IoT. Cloud Foundry is at the heart of digital transformation.

  talktitle: Conquering Scaling Challenges in IoT
  talkabstract: We all know Gartner's expectations - 20 billion connected devices by 2020. People are not going to charge tens of devices every day so we need low power communication. More and more devices are being deployed remote so we need wide area networking. With the emergence of LPWAN and the commoditization of connectivity, the industry needs to focus on new challenges&#58; life cycle optimization and environmental issues, firmware updates, transfer of ownership, spectrum regulation, security and privacy issues, and making IoT development and deployment as easy as WordPress. Learn how we aim to tackle all of this with The Things Network and its global community.

  talktitle: Building Streaming IoT platforms with Apache Kafka
  talkabstract: When we think IoT, we tend to think of the leaf-node devices; sensors, microcontrollers etc. Whilst embedded devices provide the source of the IoT value chain, they are only the tip of the iceberg. The core value of many commercial IoT platforms sits below the waterline, in the data platforms that leverage the data these devices generate. <p>Multi-TB/s ingestion rates, even with small message payloads, make Apache Kafka one of the most common backbones for large IoT installations. In this talk will look at some of the key properties of Apache Kafka and its Stream Processing API, reflecting on why these features are important for processing IoT workloads. Finally we’ll touch on some real world examples in the transport and mobile domains.

  talktitle: Digital Twins&#58; From zero to cloud scale
  talkabstract: Digital Twins are the new rage in IoT and business potential! Not really, they’ve actually been around for a long time and we’ve been doing business for millennia.  What has changed is the scale and complexity that we operate/reason over.  Numerous definitions and perspectives of digital twin make it very confusing to get started and understand why they could change the way we live and conduct business.  Let’s chat about where they came from, why they exist, how they apply to different parts of the business, how to get started, and how to scale.
