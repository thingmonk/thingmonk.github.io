  talktitle: "Eclipse hawkBit: Software Updates For The IoT"
  talkabstract: |
    Software updates are becoming a key requirement in the IoT context and especially with the growth of IoT devices connecting to the internet every day. Security Patches are one of the important and crucial things nowadays but also the ability to deploy new features, to be able to develop iterative and agile, a software update mechnism will solve the problem.<br/>
