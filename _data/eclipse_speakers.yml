  bio: Benjamin Cabé, Internet of Things enthusiast and evangelist at the Eclipse Foundation, has years of experience in connecting things, big and small, together. <p>He is advocating the use of open source technologies to build Internet of Things solutions, which led him to cofound the Eclipse IoT Working Group in 2011. This working group has become a thriving community of 25+ open source projects, hundreds of developers, and thousands of users.
  talktitle: "Open Source Internet of Things: an overview of Eclipse IoT"
  talkabstract: IoT is the new black, and you sure want to be trendy and cool, and claim that you're doing IoT too! Open source initiatives like Eclipse IoT have your back covered by providing you with the building blocks needed for enabling IoT solutions. <p>We would like to welcome you to the Eclipse IoT Day by giving you an introduction to the key challenges of IoT and an overview of the approach undertaken by Eclipse IoT to develop an ecosystem of open-source technologies that will help you connect and manage your current and future IoT devices.

  bio: Kai Hudalla has been working at Bosch on solutions for the Internet of Things in application domains like smart home, energy management, e-mobility, and automotive long before the term reached its recent popularity and ubiquity. <br>He is an active committer on several Eclipse IoT projects and has just recently started the Hono project together with other members from the community, aiming at providing an integration platform for connecting millions of devices to the cloud. <p>Kai holds a degree in mathematics from University of Hannover in Germany and enjoys playing a round of golf whenever weather conditions permit."
  talktitle: Towards an Open IoT Stack for the Cloud
  talkabstract: Throughout the last years the open source community has produced a lot of valuable technology for implementing IoT applications. However, most of this technology still requires a lot of low-level knowledge in order to make proper use of it. Now the time has come to take this technology to the next level. <p>Let me tell you about the latest efforts within the IoT Working Group at Eclipse to create an open source based stack of components for implementing IoT solutions at cloud scale.

  bio: Patrizia Gufler has been fascinated about the Internet of Things for years, and joined IBM in 2015 to work on everything IoT, from helping customers transition to an IoT mindset, to helping build Watson IoT and creating all sort of cool demos for tradeshows. On her free time, she enjoys hiking, biking, skiing, and anything that involves going out in the mountains.
  talktitle: Connecting Eclipse Kura to IBM Watson
  talkabstract: Eclipse Kura is a modular and extensible platform for building IoT gateways. In this talk you will learn more about the main features of Kura, and how easy it is to extend it with support for new IoT cloud platforms like IBM Watson IoT.

  bio: Boris Adryan ("Boris", or "Dr. Adryan") has a long-standing interest in big data analytics and machine learning. From 2008 to 2015 he lead a method development group at the University of Cambridge. Since 2013 he has been a consultant and hired hand for mostly London based IoT companies. In 2016 Boris did his personal Brexit and joined Zühlke Engineering in Frankfurt to support their IoT and data analytics activities.
  talktitle: IoT, Info Models and Ontologies
  talkabstract: How do devices in the Internet of Things communicate their abilities? Independent of any representation of a device in a programming language or an IoT platform, a good information model can capture features and properties of a physical device, which can be translated into unambiguous code or domain-specific languages. The Eclipse Vorto project offers a set of tools and a platform that can be used to develop and share information models and code generators. Information models can further be augmented with ontological information, i.e. how devices relate to each other (think ‘thermostat’ and ‘boiler’). This talk is going to provide a high-level overview of Vorto and why the Eclipse SmartHome project has recently started to engage with ontologies.
